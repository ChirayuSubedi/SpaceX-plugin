# Getting Started

Just install and activate the plugin. Then, you can use the shortcode `[space]` to display launches list.

## Pages
The page will be automatically created but you need to add them to the menu manually. However, you can visit the lauches page by visiting the following URL: `http://yourdomain.com/launches/`. ( Assuming that you are using pretty permalinks)

## The plugin will create the following pages:
- Launches
- History
